## Summary

### Drawbacks of the webpage:
- The search field is "case-sensitive". It means that the outcome table will not update if the entry does not have exact match. 

### Recommendations:
- Entry fields would be more efficient if they were dropdown lists. As it would eliminate the "case-sensitivity" problem.
- It would be better to work on custimization of the webpage. e.g. "Click" button, "Clear the filter" button.
- Adding functionality to pull the "fresh" data from live source.
